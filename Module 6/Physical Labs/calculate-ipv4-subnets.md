## Reflection Question

**Why is the subnet mask so important when analyzing an IPv4 address?**  
_Answer: It can tell you how many hosts could potentially be on the same network as the device whose IP you are looking at. It can also tell you what the gateway and broadcast will be if it is not already known.
